I have chosen the “Interests” quiz and the first thought that crossed my
mind upon seeing it was that this is really similar to the all kinds of
political compasses and personality tests that I used to take a couple
of years ago. Nowadays I consider them too much of a simplification of
one's whole character and my issue with this particular quiz is the
same. There is no way to direct someone to a whole path of life by
asking only 50 questions. I believe talking to the people who know you
is much better at accomplishing the goal of self-discovery if you have
trouble asking yourself who you are now and who you want to be in the
future. But let's not get sidetracked, let's answer the questions
instead.

1. Does this job seem interesting to you? why or why not?

The possible jobs I’ve got were a hit or miss. There were some that I
would have no interest in taking and others that I would certainly want
to try out in the future. Reason for why I think that happened is stated
above.

2. What sorts of skills do you need to be successful at the job/career
path?

Definitely some self-organization and the power to restrain myself from
procrastinating and doing a whole load of nothing in my free time.

3. Where do you see yourself in 5, 10 years? In which job/career?

Why do I feel like I'm being interviewed? Alright, but jokes aside, I
can’t exactly tell who I will be in the future but I can narrow it down
to a creative and invidual field. Working in a corporation just wouldn’t
bring joy to my life, regardless of the salary. For now I think that a
voice actor profession would suit me just right.
