Better Place

Sometimes I dream of a Better Place

There is no fear there, there is no war

It floats in ether like stars in the space

And shines with brightness not seen at all

I've got there finally with hope in mind

It flew through me like a windy breeze

My Better Place was nowhere in sight

Only a city that broke in ease

I recollected some of the fragments

Some streets and ashes of human souls

Among them also were my alignments

My pride and hustle, my flesh and bones

My mind is aching, the earth is shaking

This city shattered countless times already

I am a victim of my own making

My eyes are blinded, my fate is ready

Blood drips through walls of my inner palace

Ceiling is falling, the crash is loud

I'm locked up in the eternal balance

I try to scream, but there is no sound

There is no echo, only the hunger

That still feeds off me everywhere I go

It's seeking freedom like a trapped tiger

It eats my flesh and it eats my soul

I turn to ashes like those before me

Someday you'll come here in your naive search

Search that will kill you firmly and promptly

Search for the echoes of the Better Place
